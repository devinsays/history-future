Source files for Byron Reese's site at http://byronreese.com.

Feel free to use the code as a reference, but (obviously) don't duplicate the site or copy the design.

This theme site was crafted by Brian Dillion and Devin Price at Demand Media.

A number of other open source projects were used, hacked, and thrown together in order to get this site out the door.
